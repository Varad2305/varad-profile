In this project, we propose an Attention based bi-directional LSTM to detect anomalies in the fly in univariate time series data. We achieve results that beat current state-of-the-art models on the basis of F-Score and AUC on the [Numenta Anomaly Benchmark](https://github.com/numenta/NAB). We also propose new baselines for the task which are recently published models that show promise in other fields but were not used on this dataset.

A paper on this project was submitted to the International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks and we're awaiting a notification.
You can find more details of the project [here](https://github.com/Varad2305/Time-Series-Anomaly-Detection).
